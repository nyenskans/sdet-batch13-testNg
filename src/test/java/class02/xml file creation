right click on project --> create xml file
right click on project --> reload disc
--> xml file is in target folder in the bottom
code--> reformat
--> delete everything between <classes>  </classes>
- rename the file!
// we determine which classes we want to run as tests:
             <classes>
                        <class name="class02.EnableDisable"></class>
                        <class name="class01.testNGAnnotations"></class>
                        <class name="class02.Priority"></class>
             </classes>
--> right click --> run xml

// to create a new xml file, follow the steps again from after installing plug in




If we want to execute particular methods, we write:
 <classes>
      <class name="class02.Priority">
             <methods>

                     <include name="firstTest"></include>  // will be run
                     <exclude name="secondTest"></exclude> // will not be run
             </methods>
      </class>
 </classes>

// it's a good practice to write all the methods in a class and say include or exclude
//even though if you omitted excluded ones, they wouldn't be executed anyway

// the methods in xml will executed based on priority we gave them within the original class


In testNG we have either package or class based test execution
