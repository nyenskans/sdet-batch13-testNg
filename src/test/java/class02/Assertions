Library Assert comes from TestNG
We use Assertions instead of if conditions, because we want the test the fail in testng if the condition is not met
(in if condition, the message is displayed/ or code is executed, but the test passes, which shouldn't happen)

1. Hard Assertions

Assert.AssertEquals(Expected value, Actual value)
                    - if they are equal, the test will pass
                    - if they are not equal, the test will fail

2. Soft Assertions
They won't stop the execution of the script

first assertion that we learned is
1.Assert.AssertEquals(String , String)
it comapres two strings if they are equal test case passed else fails.
2.Assert.AssetTrue(boolean)-->if the boolean is True the Assertion will pass
								if the boolean is false the assertion will fail
1.HardAssertions
As soon as any assertion FAIlS it doesnt check for other assertions , marks the test as failed and quits
Assert.Assertequals(Expected value,Actual Value)-->if they are equal your test case will pass
`												--> if they are not equal your test case is going to FAIL
2.SoftAssertions:
Soft asseertion will execute all assertions that are there despite of the fact that they FAIL or PASS
and once it has evaluated them all then it will mark the test case as
Failed or Passed
(it marks it failed even if one assertion has failed)
The advantage of using soft asssert is that we can
see what errors we are having in other assertions that we make in the same test case
but we cant see them if we use hardassertion as IT WILL EXIT AS SOON AS THE FIRST ASSERTION FAILS
method to implement:
1. delcare the instance
softAssert soft =new softAssert();
2.make assertions
soft.assertEquals();
3. after making all the desired assertions
we have to do soft.assertALL()
this evaluates weather the test case has to be marked passed or failed (depending on the results of all the )
