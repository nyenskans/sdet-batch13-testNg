@DataProvider

We provide all the different data we should test under this annotation.
Then, in any test we can use it without repeating the code

We can have multiple Data Providers, so we have to assign it a name

It will be a 2Dimensional Array of type Object

We need to link the desired Data Provider to the method where we need to use it (by adding it into parenthesis by @Test,
 and by adding parameters into the method in the test)

We use it for limited data, up to 15 rows, no more than that. After that amount we should be reading data from Excel files




                    Listeners

First step is to create a Listener class which will implement interface ITestListeners
Second step is to override (implement) methods we want to use (most commonly .onSuccess() and .onFailure())
Third step is to  define our listeners in xml right after suite
So we define a listeners class (which has code to be executed in case of test case success/failure), put it in xml in
<listeners> tag and say which  class/method we want to have the listeners applied to in <classes> tag
    Listeners only listen if we run the xml file Not if we run the class itself
