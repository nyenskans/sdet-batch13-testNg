    Maven project:

Create a new maven project in Intellij


        Maven repository

maven repository - online storage for dependencies (jars)
When we use maven projects, this is where we get the path of a dependency (library) we need from to add into our pom.xml
instead of downloading jars and updating them all the time
(instead we just reload maven in intellij)

In Maven terminology, a repository is a directory where all the project jars, library jar, plugins or any other project
specific artifacts are stored and can be used by Maven easily.

    <properties> : maven version
    <dependencies> : tag for where we import jars

         What are libraries:
Libraries in programming languages are collections of prewritten code that users can use to optimize tasks
In computer programming, a library refers to a collection of files, programs, routines, scripts, or functions that can
be referenced in the programming code.

****Libraries vs Framework
Libraries provide developers with predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development
process.
Framework, on the other hand, is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms
